# My React App

This is a simple React application that displays content with dynamic images.

## Overview

The main goal of this application is to display content alongside dynamic images. Each piece of content is associated with an image, and as you scroll through the content, the image remains fixed while the content changes dynamically.

## Changes Made

In this update, we've made the following changes to the application:

- Updated the `App.js` file to render content and dynamic images.
- Added CSS rules in the `App.css` file to hide the horizontal scrollbar.
- Integrated a data file (`contentData.js`) to store content and image information.
- Applied styling to enhance the appearance of the application.
